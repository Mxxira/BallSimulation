# BallSimulation
In this project, I was looking to simply move the ball at different speeds from left to right. I was successfully able to move the ball; however, the ball is seemingly moving diagonally from left to right. 

The work I've been doing on it has been rewriting the code and debugging my code to find a solution to the problem. My goal is to move the ball from left to right, but add more to the page, so it adds a dribbling effect on the screen.
